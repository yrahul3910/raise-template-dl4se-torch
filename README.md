# DL4SE PyTorch Template v1.0

This is a template for code using deep learning for SE written with PyTorch. The repo uses the [nebulgym](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebulgym) library to speed up training. In your final repo, please remove this line, change the title of the README, and follow the instructions below. This repo hosts some functioning code. We encourage you to read through the code for some hints.

Replace this sentence with a paragraph briefly describing your work, and a link to your paper. Prefer an arXiv link over paywalled links or uploading the paper to GitHub.

## Dataset

Describe, in 1-2 lines, your datasets here. Then, include a link to the dataset. If the dataset is small enough, use this repo to store the data. Do NOT use GitHub LFS. Instead, prefer to share your data using Zenodo/Google Drive.

## Setup and instructions

In this section, provide a numbered list of instructions to reproduce your work using the code in this repository. In general, your code should be as simple to run as possible, i.e., reduce the friction of reproduction by moving the complexity to the code, not to the user reproducing your work.

1. Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Login to Weights & Biases: `wandb login`. Get your API key from https://wandb.ai/authorize
3. Run the experiments: `python3 main.py`

## Results

Optional, but it is a good idea to show your results here.

## Reference

Add a citation to your paper here.
